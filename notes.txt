send data as form data and not in body ---> not required if using https
add validations
status codes and their respective messages
rate limiting ---> to limit the number of login apis
middleware to check token is present or not for authorization

should we have same db for both rest partner app and user app???

user should be able to add address under different labels like -> home, work, other etc.
